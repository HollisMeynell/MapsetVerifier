                    Sliders before a timing line (even if just by 1 ms or less), will not be affected by its slider velocity. 
                    With 1 ms unsnaps being common for objects and lines due to rounding errors when copy pasting, this in turn 
                    becomes a common issue for all game modes (excluding mania since SV works differently there).
                    <note>
                        If bpm changes, this will still keep track of the effective slider velocity, thereby preventing false positives. 
                        So if it wouldn't make a difference, it's not pointed out.
